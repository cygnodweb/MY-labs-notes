# 📘 Data Encryption – Complete Notes

---

## 🔎 Definition

**Data Encryption** is the process of converting readable information (**plaintext**) into an unreadable format (**ciphertext**) using algorithms and encryption keys.  
Only users with the correct **decryption key** can convert it back to its original form.

## 🎯 Objectives of Data Encryption

1. **Confidentiality** – Keeps information secret from unauthorized users.
    
2. **Data Integrity** – Ensures the data is not altered during transmission.
    
3. **Authentication** – Confirms the identity of communicating parties.
    
4. **Non-Repudiation** – Prevents denial of sending or receiving information.

## 🌍 Importance of Encryption

- Protects sensitive data (personal, financial, business).
    
- Secures data both **at rest** (stored) and **in transit** (moving across networks).
    
- Prevents unauthorized access, hacking, or misuse.
    
- Builds **trust** in digital systems (e.g., online banking, e-commerce).
    

**Real-life Example:**  
If an employee stores confidential data on a USB drive without encryption, anyone can read it if stolen. With encryption, the stolen data remains unreadable.

## 🔐 Types of Data Encryption

### 1. **Symmetric Encryption**

- Same key is used for **encryption & decryption**.
    
- Faster, but **key distribution is risky**.
    
- Examples: **AES, DES, 3DES, Twofish**.
    

### 2. **Asymmetric Encryption**

- Uses a **pair of keys**:
    
    - Public Key → Encrypts data.
        
    - Private Key → Decrypts data.
        
- More secure for communication, but slower.
    
- Examples: **RSA, ECC**.

## ⚙️ How Encryption Works

1. Plaintext (original data).
    
2. Encryption Algorithm + Key → Ciphertext (scrambled data).
    
3. Ciphertext travels securely.
    
4. Decryption Algorithm + Key → Original Plaintext.
    

**States of Encryption:**

- **Data in Transit** → While being sent across networks.
    
- **Data at Rest** → While stored on devices/servers.

## 📌 Uses of Data Encryption

- **Digital Signatures** → Prove integrity & authenticity.
    
- **Digital Rights Management (DRM)** → Prevents piracy/copying.
    
- **Data Deletion** → Encrypt + destroy keys = unrecoverable data.
    
- **Data Migration** → Protects data when transferring.
    
- **VPNs & Cloud Storage** → Encrypts internet traffic & stored files.
    
- **Full Disk Encryption** → Secures entire drives.

## ✅ Advantages

- Protects data on insecure channels.
    
- Independent of device security.
    
- Ensures privacy & trust.
    
- Widely applicable (cloud, banking, emails, messaging).
    

---

## ⚠️ Disadvantages

- Loss of encryption key = **loss of data**.
    
- High resource usage (CPU, memory, processing time).
    
- Complex implementation.
    
- Improper use may reduce effectiveness.

## 🔑 Common Encryption Algorithms

- **DES (Data Encryption Standard)** → Outdated, insecure.
    
- **3DES (Triple DES)** → Better than DES, but vulnerable.
    
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** → Standard today, 128/192/256-bit keys.
    
- **RSA** → Asymmetric, used in SSL/TLS, digital signatures.
    
- **ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)** → Strong security with smaller keys.
    
- **Twofish** → Fast, flexible, open-source option.
